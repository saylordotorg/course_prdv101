##Unit 3: Stress Management
*The third and final unit in this course is entitled “Stress
Management.” The research in the field of stress tells us that
unhealthy levels of stress may be the single biggest factor in
sabotaging our otherwise well-formulated job search plan. You have
progressed through the steps of self-assessment and have explored
various resources that offer relevant information about your potential
job or career. Hopefully, you are experiencing a level of excitement
about your future. Change, however, brings feelings of uncertainty and
risk. You will learn in this unit that while it is not possible to
simply banish these thoughts from your mind, you can take steps to
recognize specific stressors in your life and learn how to “manage” or
cope with this stress. Please begin by viewing Saylor Academy's
brief video, “Recognizing and Managing Stress.”*

###3.2 Recognizing and Coping with Long Term Stress**
**Reading: MindTools™: [“The Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale: Understanding
the Impact of Long-Term
Stress”](http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTCS_82.htm) (HTML)**
 
Instructions: In 1967, Psychiatrists Thomas H. Holmes and Richard
Rahe created “The Social Readjustment Rating Scale” (called The
Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale) comprised of 43 Life Change events and
their weighted assigned value. Please click on the link above. To
take this test and score your stress levels, check the box if a
particular life event has applied to you in the past year. The
scores and their interpretations are indicated below the test.
Scores are indicators of your level of risk of becoming ill in the
very near future. Finally, MindTools™ directs you to sites which
address “What You Can Do about This?” 
 
This resource should take approximately 30 minutes to complete.

###3.3 Short-Term Stress, Causes, and Coping Tips
**Reading: MindTools™: [“Stress
Diary”](http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTCS_01.htm) (HTML)**
 
Instructions: Please click on the link above, and read this entire
webpage. This site reminds us that we are all under stress every
day. Some stress causes us to be productive, but we need to
recognize the level of stress at which we prefer to operate. By
keeping a diary, the authors suggest that you can learn to analyze
your short-term stressors (e.g. dealing with difficult people, poor
time management, burnout, etc.) and learn to manage them. You may
find it helpful to maintain a Stress Diary throughout your job
search.
 
This resource should take approximately 15 minutes to complete.

###3.4 The Power of Positive Thinking
**Reading: MindTools™: [“Are You a Positive or Negative
Thinker?”](http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTCS_89.htm) (HTML)**
 
Instructions: Please click on this link above, and read the entire
webpage to learn how positive and negative thinking can become
self-fulfilling prophesies. Positive thinkers are more optimistic,
happier, and healthier than negative thinkers and are, therefore,
associated with more positive actions and outcomes. This site
offers a quiz to determine whether you are a positive or negative
thinker. The article gives us examples of how pessimistic thinkers
frame a situation so that outcomes are self-defeating, whereas
optimists see the same event as an opportunity for gain or
change!

This reading will take approximately 15 minutes to complete.
