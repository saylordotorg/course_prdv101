**While none of us know what our future holds, some of us take proactive
steps to explore possibilities and opportunities open to us. 
Congratulations!  You are beginning an exciting journey to turn
daydreams into reality!  In order to use your time productively, you
will need to learn more about yourself, your interests and personality,
and how these factors relate to various types of jobs or careers.  This
unit offers resources to address this self-knowledge.  For example, The
Saylor Foundation’s introductory video reminds you why the initial step
in your journey needs to be self-assessment.  Secondly, you will have an
opportunity to take Jung’s Typology Test to assess your personality
type.  Finally, John Holland’s quiz will help you to understand how your
personality type is compatible with various work environments.  By
learning more about yourself, you are ensuring that your job search
strategy is appropriate to your interests and strengths.  Enjoy your
self-exploration*!*
